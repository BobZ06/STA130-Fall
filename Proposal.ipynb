    "**Analysis 1: Social Media Impact on Loneliness**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Question**  \n",
    "Is the average loneliness score higher among frequent social media users compared to the national average loneliness score?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables**  \n",
    "- **Social Media Usage**: `CONNECTION_social_media_visits_per_day`\n",
    "  - **Measurement**: Ordinal scale indicating the average number of social media visits per day.\n",
    "  - **Visualization**: Bar chart displaying the distribution of daily social media visits.\n",
    "  - **Relevance**: Identifies levels of social media engagement, allowing segmentation of users by frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loneliness Score**: `LONELY_ucla_loneliness_scale_companionship`\n",
    "  - **Measurement**: Ordinal scale measuring the frequency of feeling a lack of companionship.\n",
    "  - **Visualization**: Histogram showing the distribution of loneliness scores for the companionship variable.\n",
    "  - **Relevance**: Focuses on a specific aspect of loneliness, providing insights into how social media usage correlates with feelings of companionship.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Preprocessing**  \n",
    "1. **Data Import and Filtering**: Load `CSCS_data_anon.csv`, filter for cases where `REMOVE_case` is \"No,\" and exclude rows with missing values in these specific columns.\n",
    "2. **Segmentation**: Identify frequent social media users based on thresholds in `CONNECTION_social_media_visits_per_day`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis Method**  \n",
    "1. **Statistical Test**: Conduct a one-sample t-test (or non-parametric test, if necessary) to compare the loneliness score for companionship among frequent social media users with the national average.\n",
    "2. **Bootstrapping**: Generate confidence intervals for the loneliness score to ensure robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis and Expected Results**  \n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: The average companionship loneliness score for frequent social media users is equal to the national average.\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: The average companionship loneliness score for frequent social media users is higher than the national average.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relevance**: If frequent social media users show higher loneliness scores, it suggests a potential relationship between social media usage and loneliness, helping to identify possible risk factors for social isolation.\n",

    "**Analysis 2: Relationship Between Community Participation and Life Satisfaction**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Question**  \n",
    "Does participation in group exercises predict higher life satisfaction scores?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables**  \n",
    "- **Community Participation**: `CONNECTION_activities_group_exercise_p3m`\n",
    "  - **Measurement**: Ordinal scale indicating frequency of participation in group exercise (e.g., yoga classes, cycling).\n",
    "  - **Visualization**: Bar chart showing participation levels in group exercises.\n",
    "  - **Relevance**: Highlights engagement in physical community activities, relevant to examining potential effects on life satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Life Satisfaction**: `WELLNESS_subjective_happiness_scale_happy`\n",
    "  - **Measurement**: Continuous scale representing self-reported happiness levels.\n",
    "  - **Visualization**: Histogram showing the distribution of life satisfaction scores.\n",
    "  - **Relevance**: Serves as a measure of well-being, providing a basis for assessing the impact of group exercise participation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Preprocessing**  \n",
    "1. **Data Import and Filtering**: Load data, keeping rows where `REMOVE_case` is \"No,\" and exclude rows with missing values in these two columns.\n",
    "2. **Standardization**: Normalize the life satisfaction scale if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis Method**  \n",
    "1. **Statistical Test**: Use simple linear regression to assess whether frequency of group exercise predicts life satisfaction scores.\n",
    "2. **Bootstrapping**: Generate confidence intervals for the regression coefficient to reinforce result reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis and Expected Results**  \n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: There is no relationship between group exercise participation and life satisfaction (β = 0).\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: Higher participation in group exercise is associated with higher life satisfaction (β > 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relevance**: Positive results would suggest that community-based physical activities like group exercises could enhance life satisfaction, supporting initiatives to promote social and physical engagement for well-being.\n",

    "**Analysis 3: Social Support Network and Mental Health**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Question**  \n",
    "How does the size of one's social support network relate to mental health scores?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables**  \n",
    "- **Social Support Network Size**: `CONNECTION_social_num_close_friends_grouped`\n",
    "  - **Measurement**: Ordinal scale indicating the number of close friends.\n",
    "  - **Visualization**: Bar chart showing the distribution of social network sizes among participants.\n",
    "  - **Relevance**: Measures the extent of social support, allowing for analysis of its relationship with mental health.\n",

    "- **Mental Health**: `WELLNESS_self_rated_mental_health`\n",
    "  - **Measurement**: Ordinal scale representing self-rated mental health status.\n",
    "  - **Visualization**: Box plot to display the distribution of mental health scores across different network sizes.\n",
    "  - **Relevance**: Reflects participants’ mental health status, essential for examining its association with social network size.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Preprocessing**  \n",
    "1. **Data Import and Filtering**: Import data, filter rows based on `REMOVE_case`, and exclude rows with missing values in these columns.\n",
    "2. **Standardization**: Standardize mental health scores if necessary for consistency across network sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis Method**  \n",
    "1. **Statistical Test**: Use ordinal logistic regression or Spearman correlation to evaluate the relationship between network size and mental health scores.\n",
    "2. **Bootstrapping**: Calculate confidence intervals for each parameter to improve result reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis and Expected Results**  \n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: Social network size has no effect on mental health scores (β = 0).\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: A larger social network is associated with better mental health scores (β > 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relevance**: A significant positive association could indicate that larger social support networks contribute to better mental health, supporting strategies that promote social connections for psychological well-being.\n",
